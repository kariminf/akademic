	abstract = {  Coherence plays a critical role in producing a high-quality summary from a document. In recent years, neural extractive summarization is becoming increasingly attractive. However, most of them ignore the coherence of summaries when extracting sentences. As an effort towards extracting coherent summaries, we propose a neural coherence model to capture the cross-sentence semantic and syntactic coherence patterns. The proposed neural coherence model obviates the need for feature engineering and can be trained in an end-to-end fashion using unlabeled data. Empirical results show that the proposed neural coherence model can efficiently capture the cross-sentence coherence patterns. Using the combined output of the neural coherence model and ROUGE package as the reward, we design a reinforcement learning method to train a proposed neural extractive summarizer which is named Reinforced Neural Extractive Summarization (RNES) model. The RNES model learns to optimize coherence and informative importance of the summary simultaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed RNES outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance in term of ROUGE on CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The qualitative evaluation indicates that summaries produced by RNES are more coherent and readable.},

	abstract = "Text summarization has become an important research area, especially in the biomedical domain, where information overload is a major problem. In this paper, we propose a novel biomedical text summarization system that combines two popular data mining techniques: clustering and frequent itemset mining. Biomedical paper is expressed as a set of biomedical concepts using the UMLS metathesaurus. The K-means algorithm is used to cluster similar sentences. Then, the Apriori algorithm is applied to discover the frequent itemsets among the clustered sentences. Finally, the salient sentences from each cluster are selected to build the summary using the discovered frequent itemsets. For the evaluation step, we selected randomly 100 biomedical papers from the BioMed Central database full-text, and we evaluated the performances of our system by comparing the resulting summaries with the abstracts of these papers using the ROUGE metrics in term of recall, precision, and F-measure. We also compared the obtained summaries with those achieved by five well-known summarizers: TextRank, TextTeaser, SweSum, ItemSet Based Summarizer, Microsoft AutoSummarize, and two baselines: summarization using only the frequent itemsets mining (FRQ-CL), and summarization using only the clustering (CL-FRQ). The results demonstrate that this combination can successfully enhance the summarization performances, and the proposed system outperforms other tested summarizers."

	abstract = "Objective
	Automatic text summarization offers an efficient solution to access the ever-growing amounts of both scientific and clinical literature in the biomedical domain by summarizing the source documents while maintaining their most informative contents. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based summarization method that takes advantage of the domain-specific knowledge and a well-established data mining technique called frequent itemset mining.
	Methods
	Our summarizer exploits the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to construct a concept-based model of the source document and mapping the document to the concepts. Then, it discovers frequent itemsets to take the correlations among multiple concepts into account. The method uses these correlations to propose a similarity function based on which a represented graph is constructed. The summarizer then employs a minimum spanning tree based clustering algorithm to discover various subthemes of the document. Eventually, it generates the final summary by selecting the most informative and relative sentences from all subthemes within the text.
	Results
	We perform an automatic evaluation over a large number of summaries using the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics. The results demonstrate that the proposed summarization system outperforms various baselines and benchmark approaches.
	Conclusion
	The carried out research suggests that the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge and frequent itemset mining equips the summarization system in a better way to address the informativeness measurement of the sentences. Moreover, clustering the graph nodes (sentences) can enable the summarizer to target different main subthemes of a source document efficiently. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of the summarization systems in the biomedical domain."

This work explores the use of data-efficient content selectors to over-determine phrases in a source document that should be part of the summary. We use this selector as a bottom-up attention step to constrain the model to likely phrases. We show that this approach improves the ability to compress text, while still generating fluent summaries. This two-step process is both simpler and higher performing than other end-to-end content selection models, leading to significant improvements on ROUGE for both the CNN-DM and NYT corpus. Furthermore, the content selector can be trained with as little as 1,000 sentences making it easy to transfer a trained summarizer to a new domain.",

	abstract = "The rise in the amount of textual resources available on the Internet has created the need for tools of automatic document summarization. The main challenges of query-oriented extractive summarization are (1) to identify the topics of the documents and (2) to recover query-relevant sentences of the documents that together cover these topics. Existing graph- or hypergraph-based summarizers use graph-based ranking algorithms to produce individual scores of relevance for the sentences. Hence, these systems fail to measure the topics jointly covered by the sentences forming the summary, which tends to produce redundant summaries. To address the issue of selecting non-redundant sentences jointly covering the main query-relevant topics of a corpus, we propose a new method using the powerful theory of hypergraph transversals. First, we introduce a new topic model based on the semantic clustering of terms in order to discover the topics present in a corpus. Second, these topics are modeled as the hyperedges of a hypergraph in which the nodes are the sentences. A summary is then produced by generating a transversal of nodes in the hypergraph. Algorithms based on the theory of submodular functions are proposed to generate the transversals and to build the summaries. The proposed summarizer outperforms existing graph- or hypergraph-based summarizers by at least 6% of ROUGE-SU4 F-measure on DUC 2007 dataset. It is moreover cheaper than existing hypergraph-based summarizers in terms of computational time complexity."

We report on the use of this pipeline in a disease-specific extractive text summarization task on clinical notes, focusing primarily on progress notes by physicians and nurse practitioners. We show how the addition of EHR-specific components to the pipeline resulted in an improvement in our overall system performance and discuss the potential impact of EHR-specific components on other higher-level clinical NLP tasks.",

The following paper deals with summarization of text derived from the syntactic and semantic features of the words in the document. We apply the technique of calculating a threshold value from both the attribute and semantic structure of the individual words. The algorithm helps in calculating the threshold value in order to give weightage to a particular word in a document. Initially the document undergoes the preprocessing techniques; the obtained data will be kept in a data set, then on that data we will apply the proposed algorithm in order to get a summarized data.",

	abstract="Numerous approaches for identifying important content for automatic text summarization have been developed to date. Topic representation approaches first derive an intermediate representation of the text that captures the topics discussed in the input. Based on these representations of topics, sentences in the input document are scored for importance. In contrast, in indicator representation approaches, the text is represented by a diverse set of possible indicators of importance which do not aim at discovering topicality. These indicators are combined, very often using machine learning techniques, to score the importance of each sentence. Finally, a summary is produced by selecting sentences in a greedy approach, choosing the sentences that will go in the summary one by one, or globally optimizing the selection, choosing the best set of sentences to form a summary. In this chapter we give a broad overview of existing approaches based on these distinctions, with particular attention on how representation, sentence scoring or summary selection strategies alter the overall performance of the summarizer. We also point out some of the peculiarities of the task of summarization which have posed challenges to machine learning approaches for the problem, and some of the suggested solutions.",

	abstract = "A new approach to narrative abstractive summarization (NATSUM) is presented in this paper. NATSUM is centered on generating a narrative chronologically ordered summary about a target entity from several news documents related to the same topic. To achieve this, first, our system creates a cross-document timeline where a time point contains all the event mentions that refer to the same event. This timeline is enriched with all the arguments of the events that are extracted from different documents. Secondly, using natural language generation techniques, one sentence for each event is produced using the arguments involved in the event. Specifically, a hybrid surface realization approach is used, based on over-generation and ranking techniques. The evaluation demonstrates that NATSUM performed better than extractive summarization approaches and competitive abstractive baselines, improving the F1-measure at least by 50%, when a real scenario is simulated."

	abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;In neural abstractive summarization field, conventional sequence-to-sequence based models often suffer from summarizing the wrong aspect of the document with respect to the main aspect. To tackle this problem, we propose the task of reader-aware abstractive summary generation, which utilizes the reader comments to help the model produce better summary about the main aspect. Unlike traditional abstractive summarization task, reader-aware summarization confronts two main challenges: (1) Comments are informal and noisy; (2) jointly modeling the news document and the reader comments is challenging. To tackle the above challenges, we design an adversarial learning model named reader-aware summary generator (RASG), which consists of four components: (1) a sequence-to-sequence based summary generator; (2) a reader attention module capturing the reader focused aspects; (3) a supervisor modeling the semantic gap between the generated summary and reader focused aspects; (4) a goal tracker producing the goal for each generation step. The supervisor and the goal tacker are used to guide the training of our framework in an adversarial manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on our large-scale real-world text summarization dataset, and the results show that RASG achieves the stateof-the-art performance in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluations. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of each module in our framework. We release our large-scale dataset for further research&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&#38;gt;

To tackle the above difficulties, we propose a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework with two novel extensions for abstractive document summarization. Specifically, (1) to encode the documents comprehensively, we design a focus-attention mechanism and incorporate it into the encoder. This mechanism models a Gaussian focal bias on attention scores to enhance the perception of local context, which contributes to producing salient and informative summaries. (2) To distinguish salient information precisely, we design an independent saliency-selection network which manages the information flow from encoder to decoder. This network effectively reduces the influences of secondary information on the generated summaries. Experimental results on the popular CNN/Daily Mail benchmark demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines on the ROUGE metrics.",

	abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The  prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/. To engineer a search  engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search  engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.}

In contrast to previous approaches which have relied on linguistically motivated document representations to generate summaries, our model induces a multi-root dependency tree while predicting the output summary. Each root node in the tree is a summary sentence, and the subtrees attached to it are sentences whose content relates to or explains the summary sentence. We design a new iterative refinement algorithm: it induces the trees through repeatedly refining the structures predicted by previous iterations. We demonstrate experimentally on two benchmark datasets that our summarizer performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods.",

	abstract = "Text summarization techniques become paramount in extracting relevant information from large databa-ses. Current paper attempts to build some extractive single document text summarization (ESDS) systems using multi-objective optimization (MOO) frameworks. Three techniques are proposed: (1) first is an integration of self-organizing map (SOM) and multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) (named as ESDS_SMODE) (2) second is based on multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (ESDS_MGWO) and (3) third is based on multi-objective water cycle algorithm (ESDS_MWCA). The sentences present in the document are first clustered utilizing the concept of multi-objective clustering. Two objective functions measuring compactness and separation of the sentence clusters in two different ways are optimized simultaneously using MOO framework. The proposed approach is able to automatically detect the number of sentence clusters present in a document and then representative sentences are selected from different clusters using some sentence scoring features to generate the summary. The experiments were conducted on two benchmark datasets, DUC2001, and DUC2002, and the obtained results are compared with various state-of-the-art techniques using ROUGE measures. Results illustrate the superiority of our approach in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of ROUGE‚àí2 score for both datasets. Code of the developed approach ESDS_SMODE is available online at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WagTeIDLgphttPrKHpnF_eO7QHWJxXxK."

Also, there is lack of good multi-document based human-authored datasets to train any encoder-decoder models. To overcome this, we have designed complementary models for two different tasks such as sentence clustering and neural sentence fusion. In this work, we minimize the risk of producing incorrect fact by encoding a related set of sentences as an input to the encoder. We have applied our complementary models to implement a full abstractive multi-document summarization system which simultaneously considers importance, coverage, and diversity under a desired length limit. We conduct extensive experiments for all the proposed models which bring significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods across different evaluation metrics."

	the minimum description length (MDL) principle that employs Krimp compression
	algorithm (Vreeken et al., 2011). The key idea of our approach is to select
	frequent word sets related to a given query that compress document sentences
	better and therefore describe the document better.
	A summary is extracted by selecting sentences that best cover query-related
	frequent word sets.
	The approach is evaluated based on the DUC 2005 and DUC 2006 datasets which are
	specifically designed for query-based summarization (DUC, 2005 2006). It
	competes with the best results.},

Tight constraints reveal only common knowledge, while loose constraints lead to an explosion in the number of returned patterns. This is caused by large groups of patterns essentially describing the same set of transactions. In this paper we approach this problem using the MDL principle: the best set of patterns is that set that compresses the database best. For this task we introduce the Krimp algorithm. Experimental evaluation shows that typically only hundreds of itemsets are returned; a dramatic reduction, up to seven orders of magnitude, in the number of frequent item sets. These selections, called code tables, are of high quality. This is shown with compression ratios, swap-randomisation, and the accuracies of the code table-based Krimp classifier, all obtained on a wide range of datasets. Further, we extensively evaluate the heuristic choices made in the design of the algorithm.",
